# Automobile-Mpg-Prediction
## In this project, our aim is to develop a predictive model using various regression techniques to estimate the miles per gallon (mpg) of vehicles. This model will leverage a range of features to accurately predict fuel efficiency.

The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes

## Features include:
1. mpg: mile per gallon (target feature)
2. cylinders: number of cylinders
3. displacement: the amount of air its engine can move
4. horsepower: the power produced
5. weight: weight of the car
6. acceleration: acceleration of car
7. model year: manufacturing year of the car
8. origin: manufacturing location of the car
9. car name: name of the car, string (unique for each instance)

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This step will involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis. Key activities include checking for linearity, identifying and managing outliers, and assessing normality of the data. We will also explore correlations between variables to better understand the dataset.
2. Model Development: We will build multiple predictive models using different regression techniques. This may include not only Linear Regression but also other models like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, etc.
3. Model Evaluation: Each model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values to determine their performance.
4. Model Selection: Based on the evaluation metrics, we will select the best-performing model for future prediction of miles per gallon (mpg).
